# Ultrasonic-PingPong-Game
Using Ultrasonic Sensor HCSR-04 to get distance.Another way processing will get the distance.In that way that pingpong game can able to use the distance to control paddle.
## Arduino
Using Ultrasonic Sensor HCSR-04 to input.<br>
Receive duration of pulse from the pin HIGH to the pin LOW.<br>
Calculate distance of real world distance from duration.<br>

`Attention!Delay can't able to high.Or the movement will not change immediately as what distance you want.`
## Processing
First setup All the forward user interface lobby,gaming.<br>
Second use keyboard test.<br>
Third programming the values.<br>
Forth input arduino Serial.<br>
Fifth distance to control.<br>

`The distance will be a little bit hard.The values will cause some problem.`
